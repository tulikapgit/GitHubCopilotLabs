# GitHub Copilot Labs

Demo project for running labs to evaluate Copilot viability

## Goal

The goal of GitHub Copilot labs is to learn how to use it, using a set of [exercises (labs)](#labs-instructions) 

Also a series of [challenges](#challenges-instructions) to test your skills. In this case, you will find an introduction and short guidance to help you solve the challenge, but you will have to do most of the work on your own (with the help of Copilot, of course).

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or entire functions based on the context of what youâ€™re working on. By using Copilot, you can learn how to write better code and improve your productivity.

Remember:

- As you type GitHub Copilot will make suggestions, you can accept them by pressing Tab.
- If nothing shows up after Copilot write some lines, press enter and wait a couple of seconds.
- Press **Ctrl + Enter**, to see more suggestions.
- Use Copilot chat to support your learning and development.
- Press **Ctrl + i** to start Copilot chat inline within your code.
